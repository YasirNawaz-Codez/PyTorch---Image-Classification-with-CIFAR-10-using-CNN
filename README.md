# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates image classification using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework. It's trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset and achieves an accuracy of around 60% on the test set. The project serves as a practical example of applying PyTorch for building and training image classification models.

## Features

* **PyTorch Implementation:** Utilizes PyTorch for building and training the CNN model.
* Trains a CNN on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
* Evaluates the model's performance on the test set.
* Saves and loads the trained model weights.
* Predicts the class labels of new images.
